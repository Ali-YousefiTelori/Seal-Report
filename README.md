<a href="http://www.sealreport.org" target=_blank>Seal Report</a> offers a complete framework for producing daily reports and dashboards from any database.

The product focuses on **easy installation** and **report design**: Once setup, reports can be built and published in a minute. 

<a href="http://www.sealreport.org" target=_blank>Seal Report</a> is an Open Source tool for the Microsoft .Net Framework entirely written in C#.

## Main Features
* **Dynamic SQL sources**: Use either your SQL or let the Seal engine build dynamically the SQL used to query your database.
* **Native Pivot Tables**: Simply drag and drop elements directly in a pivot table (Cross Tab) and display them in your report.
* **HTML 5 Charts** and **Microsoft Charts**: Define and display Chart Series in two mouse clicks.
* **Drill Down navigation and Sub Reports:** Navigate in your report result to drill to a detail or to execute another report.
* **Report Tasks:** Define tasks to perform your batch operations (data load, excel load, backup, data processing, etc.) or to trigger procedures from external assemblies.
* **No SQL Data Sources:**
Fill up your source Data Tables from your own code and display them in a report.
* **HTML Rendering using Razor engine**: Use the power of HTML5 in the report result (JQuery Tabs, Tables sorting and filtering). Customize your report presentation in HTML with the Razor engine parsing.
* **Web Report Server**: Publish and edit your reports on the web (requires Internet Information Server 7 or 8 with MVC4)
* **Task scheduler**: Schedule your report executions and generate results in folders or send them by emails (integrated with the Windows Tasks Scheduler)
* **Low TCO (total cost of ownership)**: The product is designed for minimal ongoing maintenance.

A **live demonstration** of the <a href="http://demo.sealreport.org" target=_blank>Web Report Server</a> is available.

**Quick start guides**  for building reports are available at the <a href="http://www.sealreport.org" target=_blank>Seal Report</a> Web site.
